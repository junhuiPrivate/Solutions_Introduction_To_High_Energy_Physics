# Solutions_Introduction_To_High_Energy_Physics
Author: Jun Liao (junhui.private@gmail.com, or, junhui_liao@brown.edu)
The solutions are the exercises assigned by a professor when I was a TA at UCLouvain, Belgium. Most of the exercises come from the textbook of "Introduction to Hight Energy Physics (4th)".
Nobody can use these solutions for any commercial purposes. Also, I won't respond for any possible problems / issues if one utilize my solutions. If you used the solutions, kindly please acknowledge me in your presentation or homework etc.
Thank you.
